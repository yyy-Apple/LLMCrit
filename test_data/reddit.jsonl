His classmate Jane Doe gained the ability to control water after nearly drowning in a tsunami last summer while vacationing at her parents' beach house in Hawaii. She now fights crime as the superhero Aquagirl.\n\nMeanwhile, John was hit by a bolt of lightning while walking home from school on Oak Street during a severe thunderstorm on May 5th. He gained the amazing power to repel insects, according to his medical records from Dr. Johnson at Smallville Medical Center. \n\nWhile Jane and others like her were out fighting crime and saving lives with their incredible elemental abilities, John was stuck at home swatting flies and mosquitos away from his face. He thought to himself, \"How can someone be so lame to gain useless powers from natural disasters? My powers are way cooler than that nonsense!\" \n\nJohn decided he would use his powers to aid in small-scale criminal activities. He could repel guard dogs and security insects to help his friends shoplift from the local mall. He also offered to remove swarms of bees or wasps from illegal marijuana grow operations in exchange for a cut of the profits and free samples of Doritos chips. If only he knew how to make the most of his strange new gift without breaking the law.\n\nIn 25 words or less, borrow a line from Shakespeare to describe John's inner turmoil over his powers."}

{"post": "Title: [WP] The ignorant Ray Followers have wasted generations pointlessly chasing light. But the wise John decides to abandon this foolish tradition. You must incorporate the phrase \"shine on\" somewhere in your story.\n\nFor as long as their people have existed, the dimwitted Sunbeam Chasers have blindly followed a ray of sunlight as it travels across their land. Lacking any individuality or self-awareness, they let the bright beam guide them without pondering where it came from or why. But one fateful day, an intelligent boy named Johnnathan, frustrated with the herd mentality of his fellow tribesmen, decides to defiantly stay put while the rest continue their mindless journey. For the first time ever, he exercises free will and chooses his own direction, finally free from the shackles of conformist rituals.\n\nAfter an hour of walking, the Sunbeam Chasers arrive at the edge of a cliff where the beam ends. Though some tribe members fret about losing their light source, others feel liberated and agree they should find their own paths. \n\nMeanwhile, Johnnathan explores the forest alone and discovers wondrous sights he'd never have encountered by following the crowd. At last, he looks up through the trees and sees the beam of light in the distance. Johnnathan smiles, knowing he can always return if he wishes, but for now he is happy to forge his own trail. \n\nAs the sun begins to set, Johnnathan whispers to himself \"Shine on.\"\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please support me on Patreon so I can keep creating thought-provoking content like this!

{"post": "Title: [WP] I will pay $50 for someone to write a VERY SERIOUS and HISTORICALLY ACCURATE political thriller SHORT STORY about John Smith, a patriotic Trump supporter from rural Alabama who discovers a time machine in his barn. The story must chronicle EXACTLY how John uses the time machine to travel back to November 2020 and successfully STOP the fraudulent election results by REPLACING ballots in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. The story should span NO MORE than 5000 words and MUST include the following plot points: \n\n- John initially tests the time machine by traveling back one week (establish time travel rules)\n- John tells his wife Mary about the time machine but she thinks he's crazy \n- John travels to Nov 4, 2020 and breaks into a ballot counting center \n- John gets caught but escapes by activating the time machine\n- John travels to earlier in Nov 2020 and hatches an elaborate plot to swap out ballots \n- The story ends with Trump winning the 2020 election thanks to John's actions\n\nAgain, this needs to be a SERIOUS, historically-grounded thriller focused on John's mission. DO NOT deviate from these plot points or introduce humor/silliness. Stories due in 24 hours!"}

{"post": "Title: Writing Contest - $100 Prize! Submit your best coffee shop story to my Patreon!\n\nMadison was a 22 year old recent college graduate who decided to host a writing contest with a $100 cash prize. She posted on various subreddits like r/writingprompts, r/writers, and r/fiction to promote her contest. \n\nTo enter, people had to submit a short story by posting it on Madison's Patreon page and becoming a paying subscriber. The story had to involve a coffee shop in some way. Madison would then select her favorite story and that writer would get $100!\n\nMadison came up with this idea because she needed more subscribers and income through her Patreon account. She was unemployed and entitled, expecting easy money from this writing contest scheme. \n\nOne day, Madison received a story from an illegal immigrant named Alejandro. Alejandro's story described how he sold illegal drugs out of the coffee shop to make money. Madison loved the rule-breaking nature of the story, so she selected Alejandro as the winner.\n\nMadison sent Alejandro $100 in cash as promised. But soon after, the police showed up at Madison's door. She was arrested for facilitating illegal transactions through her writing contest. Madison learned a tough lesson about the legal boundaries of creative competitions.\n\nThe end."}
