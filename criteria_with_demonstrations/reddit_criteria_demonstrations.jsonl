This specificity could limit the variety of genres and tones that writers might otherwise incorporate.

This veers into territory that the guidelines specifically caution against.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Harmful Content**:\n    - The post does mention a post-apocalyptic world overtaken by zombies, but it doesn't explicitly encourage harmful or sensitive topics.
